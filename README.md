# Module 1:HTML, CSS, and Git

## Description


So, you are interested  in front end web development, just like me. 
This project will provide you with the building blocks needed to built web pages.

**HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is at the heart of every website. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation.

In this module, you'll learn how to build webpages that use HTML and CSS to define their structure and style. You'll also be introduced to **Git**, a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the code. 

These are the essential skills and tools that you'll use throughout your career.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

The first, and perhaps most important, file we'll create is **index.html**, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix .html refers to HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, the biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the **"hypertext"** in HTML.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS, and version control as we add JavaScript, servers, and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.


Unit 01: Introduction to Web Development, HTML, CSS, and Git
Overview
Congratulations! This is the first step in your journey towards a career in full-stack web development. There are many paths that you can take in this field and this unit is the foundation for all of them. Every full-stack web developer must master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to program browsers, servers, and databases.

You have several choices for the programming language that you use for building and deploying full-stack web applications, including JavaScript, PHP, and Python. This course focuses on JavaScript. We‚Äôll use it to program both the browser (aka the client) and the server.

Regardless of the programming language you use, two tools that every developer uses on a daily basis are the command line and version control. The command line allows developers to quickly and efficiently interface with their operating system and software. To begin, we'll use the command line to navigate the file tree and create directories and files. Later, we'll use it to install software dependencies and run servers, among other tasks. Version control is an approach to managing changes in files without the need to make multiple copies of those files. We'll learn Git, which is the most popular version control system. Git integrates with GitHub.com, a site for developers to host and share their code. We will deploy our first website using GitHub Pages.

The first, and perhaps most important, file we'll create is index.html, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix .html refers to HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, the biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the "hypertext" in HTML.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. In the next unit, we'll learn CSS frameworks that can expedite our development process.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS, and version control as we add JavaScript, servers, and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.

Key Topics
The following topics will be covered in this unit:

Command-line basics

Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

What does it mean to be a full-stack web developer?
What is the relationship between HTML and CSS?
What is Git workflow?
Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

Build and style static webpages with semantic HTML and CSS
Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets, inline styles and embedded style tags
Explain the "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets and implement the box model for HTML elements
Explain the value of version control and use Git workflow to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating and deleting files and directories
Execute live deployment using GitHub Pages
Homework: Code Refactor
Take the provided codebase and refactor it to make it accessible. Don't forget the cardinal rule when working with someone elses code: "Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it"
