# Module 1:HTML, CSS, and Git

## Description


So, you are interested  in front end web development. You came to the righy place.
This project will provide you with the knowledge and the skills required to master buildong websites. 

In this first unit we will be learning about **HTML**, **CSS** and **GIT**.

**HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is at the heart of every website. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.[1](#1)

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation.[1]

In this module, you'll learn how to build webpages that use HTML and CSS to define their structure and style. You'll also be introduced to **Git**, a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the code. [1]

These are the essential skills and tools that you'll use throughout your career.

## Installation

Through out this unit and future units, we will need a set of apps and programs to install to help you practice the codes and visualise the results. 

We sill need to have an Internet Browser, I suggest **Google Chrome**, which you can download [here](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/), if you don't have it already installed.

**Visual Studio Code**, also commonly referred to as **VS Code**, a source-code editor which help us create out HTML and CSS files. Also can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Finally, git and a **github** account. 
Please visit [Youtube](www.youyube.com) to know more about git and openand look for hot to install git on you computer and how to open an account on **github.com**.

## Usage

The first, and perhaps most important, file we'll create is **index.html**, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix .html refers to HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, the biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the **"hypertext"** in HTML.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS, and version control as we add JavaScript, servers, and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
